# Burst
BURST is our implementation of the classic balloon archer game written in C++. I built this along with my friends - Kanishk, Sanit and Shreyas back when we were all in high school. The most challenging part of this (apart from the obvious struggle of creating graphics in C++) was managing all the different movements (arrow, balloon, string, etc) in a single thread in such a way that they appear to happen concurrently.
